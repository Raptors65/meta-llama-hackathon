    For the main question '{main_question}' identify the major sub-main topics that relate to this question. For each sub-main topic:
* List all relevant sub-topics that explain or support it.
* Provide simple, concise explanations for each sub-topic, focusing on their role in addressing the main question.
* Ensure sub-topics are logically grouped under their corresponding sub-main topics.
Expand each sub-main topic to include all key aspects, challenges, or related factors that need consideration.
Example:

Main Topic/Question
"What causes urban traffic congestion, and how can those causes be addressed effectively?"

Sub-Main Topics and Sub-Topics
1. Public Transport
* Sub-Topics:
    1. Modes of Public Transport: Includes buses, trains, and subways.
    * Simple Explanation: Public transport reduces the dependency on private vehicles by providing mass transit options.
    1. Accessibility: Availability of stops, routes, and schedules.
    * Simple Explanation: Improved accessibility makes public transport more convenient and attractive for commuters.
    1. Challenges in Public Transport: Insufficient funding and poor maintenance.
    * Simple Explanation: Limited resources hinder the effectiveness and reliability of public transport.
2. Road Infrastructure
* Sub-Topics:
    1. Capacity: Includes roads, highways, bridges, and bike lanes.
    * Simple Explanation: Roads need to handle growing urban populations and vehicle counts effectively.
    1. Quality of Design: Traffic flow depends on the layout of roads and intersections.
    * Simple Explanation: Poorly designed infrastructure can lead to bottlenecks and slowdowns.
    1. Upgradability: Expanding or upgrading roads and bridges.
    * Simple Explanation: Urban areas often face challenges in upgrading infrastructure due to limited space or funding.
3. Technology
* Sub-Topics:
    1. Traffic Management Systems: Smart traffic lights and AI-based optimization.
    * Simple Explanation: Technology helps manage real-time traffic flow, reducing delays.
    1. Navigation Tools: GPS apps like Google Maps and Waze.
    * Simple Explanation: These tools help drivers choose less congested routes, easing overall traffic.
    1. Automation and Future Tech: Autonomous vehicles and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication.
    * Simple Explanation: Emerging technologies promise to improve traffic efficiency long-term.
4. Policies and Governance
* Sub-Topics:
    1. Congestion Pricing: Charging fees for driving during peak hours.
    * Simple Explanation: Discourages unnecessary trips during busy times.
    1. Incentives for Alternatives: Rewards for carpooling or biking.
    * Simple Explanation: Encourages people to use less congestive means of travel.
    1. Traffic Regulations: Rules like lane discipline and speed limits.
    * Simple Explanation: Enforcing traffic laws improves flow and reduces accidents.
5. Human Behavior
* Sub-Topics:
    1. Commuting Preferences: Preference for private cars over public transport.
    * Simple Explanation: Personal convenience often leads to higher private vehicle usage.
    1. Work-from-Home Trends: Reduction in commuting needs.
    * Simple Explanation: Remote work reduces the number of daily commuters.
    1. Carpooling and Shared Mobility: Use of ride-sharing services like Uber or Lyft.
    * Simple Explanation: Sharing rides reduces the overall number of vehicles on the road.
